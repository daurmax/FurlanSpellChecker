# Behavioral Compatibility Analysis: Python vs COF Spell Checker

This document summarizes the behavioral analysis performed between the Python FurlanSpellChecker implementation and the original COF (Corretor Ortografic Furlan) Perl implementation.

## Testing Approach

We created comprehensive behavioral validation tests that use the real Friulian databases extracted from the project's ZIP archives. This ensures we're testing against the same underlying linguistic data.

## Database Setup

- **Real Database Extraction**: Created `tests/database_utils.py` to automatically extract databases from ZIP files in `data/databases/`
- **Extracted Files**: 
  - `words.db` (442.2 MB) - Main dictionary
  - `words.rt` (28.9 MB) - Radix tree for efficient lookups
  - `frequencies.sqlite` (2.4 MB) - Word frequency data
  - `errors.sqlite` (0.0 MB) - Error correction mappings
  - `elisions.sqlite` (0.4 MB) - Elision handling rules

## Key Findings

### 1. Core Functionality Works

The Python implementation successfully:
- ✅ Initializes with real databases
- ✅ Returns suggestions for valid Friulian words (`furlan` → `['furlan']`)
- ✅ Handles complex words (`cjase` → `['cjase', 'casse', 'cjace', 'casei', 'cjatie']`)
- ✅ Processes single characters (`a` → `['a', 'ai', 'ah', 'ahi', 'à']`)
- ✅ Manages special Friulian characters (`gnôf` → `['gnûf', 'smôf']`)
- ✅ Handles elisions (`l'aghe` → `['la aghe', 'lasse', 'lassi', 'laîisi', 'laîsi']`)

### 2. Behavioral Differences from COF

#### Error Corrections
**COF Behavior**: `furla` → `["furlan", "", "", "", ""]` (furlan as first suggestion)  
**Python Behavior**: `furla` → `[]` (no suggestions)

**Analysis**: The Python implementation doesn't contain the same error correction mapping for `furla → furlan` that COF has. This is likely due to:
- Different error database contents
- Different error detection algorithms
- Missing specific error correction rules

#### Hyphen Handling
**COF Behavior**: `cjase-parol` → `["cjase paron", "cjase parom", "cjase parot", ...]`  
**Python Behavior**: `cjase-parol` → `[]` (no suggestions)

**Analysis**: The Python implementation doesn't currently implement hyphen splitting and recombination like COF does.

#### Case Handling
**COF Behavior**: Preserves case style across suggestions  
**Python Behavior**: Generally preserves case for known words, returns empty for unknown words

### 3. Successful Compatibility Areas

#### Elision Expansion
Both implementations handle elision expansion correctly:
- `l'aghe` → `la aghe` (first suggestion)
- `un'ore` → `une ore` (first suggestion) 
- `d'estât` → `di estât` (first suggestion)

#### Special Characters
Both handle Friulian characters appropriately:
- `gnôf` → `gnûf` (character normalization)
- `çucarut` → suggests variants with cedilla handling

#### Phonetic Matching
Both provide phonetically similar suggestions for existing words.

## Test Coverage

Our test suite (`tests/test_real_databases.py`) includes:

### TestRealDatabaseIntegration
- Database file verification
- Suggestion engine initialization
- Core suggestion functionality
- Elision handling
- Case preservation
- Special character handling
- Nonsense word handling

### TestCOFBehavioralParity  
- Real database sample validation
- Elision behavior comparison
- Frequency-based ranking
- Case style preservation across different inputs

## Implementation Status

| Feature | Python Status | COF Compatibility | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Dictionary Lookup | ✅ Working | ✅ Compatible | Uses same database files |
| Phonetic Suggestions | ✅ Working | ✅ Compatible | Similar algorithm results |
| Elision Expansion | ✅ Working | ✅ Compatible | Handles l'/la, d'/di patterns |
| Case Preservation | ✅ Working | ⚠️ Partial | Works for existing words |
| Error Corrections | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Different | Missing some COF mappings |
| Hyphen Handling | ❌ Missing | ❌ Different | Not implemented |
| Frequency Ranking | ✅ Working | ✅ Compatible | Uses same frequency data |

## Recommendations

1. **Error Database Enhancement**: Investigate differences between COF and Python error correction databases
2. **Hyphen Implementation**: Add hyphen splitting and recombination logic to match COF behavior  
3. **Case Handling**: Improve case preservation for words without direct matches
4. **Performance Validation**: Compare suggestion speed and memory usage between implementations

## Conclusion

The Python FurlanSpellChecker implementation demonstrates strong compatibility with COF for core dictionary operations, phonetic matching, and elision handling. The main differences are in error correction mappings and hyphen processing, which represent areas for future enhancement rather than fundamental compatibility issues.

The test suite provides a solid foundation for validating behavioral parity and can be extended as features are enhanced to closer match COF behavior.
